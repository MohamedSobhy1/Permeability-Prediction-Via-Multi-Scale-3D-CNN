# Generalizable-Permeability-Prediction-Via-Novel-Multi-Scale-3D-CNN

**Data:**

The data includes sub-volumes of the following rocks,
  - Bentheimer Sandstone 
  - Ketton Limestone
  - Berea Sandstone
  - Doddington Sandstone
  - Estaillades Limestone
  - Carbonate (C1)
  - Carbonate (C2)

The raw CT rock cores are obtained from the [Imperial Colloge London portal](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/pore-scale-modelling/micro-ct-images-and-networks/).

The sub-volumes are simulated for absolute permeability using OpenFOAM and their results are summerized in the provided excel sheet having the following information,

 - Number of sub-samples = 65,248
 - Labels description:
    - casename = sub-sampling index per rock type sample
    - porosity = ratio of void fraction
    - eff_porosity = the connected porosity
    - rock_type =

    - AR = anisotropy ratio
    - DOA = degree of anisotropy
    - k = absolute permeability
